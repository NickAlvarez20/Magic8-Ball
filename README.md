## Project Name
Magic 8 Ball
## About
This project is a web-based simulation of a Magic 8 Ball, built using p5.js. It generates random numbers to display different messages with unique colors and text styling, mimicking the classic fortune-telling toy. The program draws a black circle with a blue triangle and displays one of four possible messages ("PRAISE GOD," "PRAISE JESUS," "PRAISE HOLY SPIRIT," or "PRAISE HOLY TRINITY") based on a random number between 1 and 4.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a modern web browser installed on your system. The project uses the p5.js library, which is included via CDN in the index.html file. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This Magic 8 Ball includes these features:

-Generates random numbers between 1 and 4 using floor(random(1, 5)) in p5.js

-Maps random values to four unique messages: "PRAISE GOD," "PRAISE JESUS," "PRAISE HOLY SPIRIT," or "PRAISE HOLY TRINITY"

-Applies distinct colors to messages (e.g., pink, red, yellow, cyan) based on the generated value

-Adjusts text sizing for visual hierarchy (20px for "PRAISE," 15px for secondary text)

-Draws a black circle with a blue triangle to simulate the Magic 8 Ball's appearance

-Interactive web-based simulation of a classic Magic 8 Ball toy

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/Magic8-Ball.git`
## Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the Magic 8 Ball simulation. The canvas will display a black circle with a blue triangle, and a randomly selected message will appear with corresponding color and text styling. Reload the page to generate a new random message.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Learn random number generation and conditional logic in JavaScript with p5.js

-Practice DOM manipulation and canvas rendering for dynamic content

-Apply CSS-like styling (via p5.js fill and textSize) for conditional visual effects

-Build an interactive web application simulating a real-world object

-Understand how to integrate p5.js for graphical programming
